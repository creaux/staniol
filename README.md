Staniol
=======

Packaging system for LESS CSS objects.

Staniol is currently really alpha it means that functionality is really basic.

Usage
-----

Install staniol using node.js npm packaging system:
```npm install -g staniol```

Install package using staniol:
```npm install [package]```

It will create folder staniol_components in your current folder.
This directory will contain packages by name and two initial less files first one for imports `importer.less` and second one for variables `variables.less`.
Both of them are used automaticaly and for implementation to you project you should only add or compile `importer.less`.
